# Classical Cipher Toolkit

A Python-based toolkit for implementing and cracking classical cryptographic ciphers. Features Caesar cipher, Vigenère cipher, and automated cryptanalysis using frequency analysis.

## Features

- 🔐 **Caesar Cipher** - Encrypt/decrypt with shift cipher
- 🗝️ **Vigenère Cipher** - Polyalphabetic encryption with keywords  
- 🕵️ **Cryptanalysis** - Automatic Caesar cipher cracking using frequency analysis
- 📊 **Debug Mode** - See how the cracking algorithm works
- 🎯 **Dictionary Attack** - Enhanced cracking with English word detection
